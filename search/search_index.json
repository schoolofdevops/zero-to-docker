            "text": "Getting Started with Docker\n\n\nIn this chapter, we are going to learn about docker shell, the command line utility and how to use it to\nlaunch containers. We will also learn what it means to run a container, its lifecycle and perform basic\noperations such as creating, starting, stopping, removing, pausing containers and checking the status etc.\n\n\nUsing docker cli\n\n\nWe can use docker cli to interact with docker daemon. Various functions of docker command is given below. Try this yourself by runnig \n$sudo docker\n command  \n\n\ndocker\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nUsage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]\n       docker [ --help | -v | --version ]\n\nA self-sufficient runtime for containers.\n\nOptions:\n\n  --config=~/.docker              Location of client config files\n  -D, --debug                     Enable debug mode\n  -H, --host=[]                   Daemon socket(s) to connect to\n  -h, --help                      Print usage\n  -l, --log-level=info            Set the logging level\n  --tls                           Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify\n  --tlscacert=~/.docker/ca.pem    Trust certs signed only by this CA\n  --tlscert=~/.docker/cert.pem    Path to TLS certificate file\n  --tlskey=~/.docker/key.pem      Path to TLS key file\n  --tlsverify                     Use TLS and verify the remote\n  -v, --version                   Print version information and quit\n\nCommands:\n    attach    Attach to a running container\n    build     Build an image from a Dockerfile\n    commit    Create a new image from a container's changes\n    cp        Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem\n    create    Create a new container\n    diff      Inspect changes on a container's filesystem\n    events    Get real time events from the server\n    exec      Run a command in a running container\n    export    Export a container's filesystem as a tar archive\n    history   Show the history of an image\n    images    List images\n    import    Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image\n    info      Display system-wide information\n    inspect   Return low-level information on a container, image or task\n    kill      Kill one or more running containers\n    load      Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN\n    login     Log in to a Docker registry.\n    logout    Log out from a Docker registry.\n    logs      Fetch the logs of a container\n    network   Manage Docker networks\n    node      Manage Docker Swarm nodes\n    pause     Pause all processes within one or more containers\n    port      List port mappings or a specific mapping for the container\n    ps        List containers\n    pull      Pull an image or a repository from a registry\n    push      Push an image or a repository to a registry\n    rename    Rename a container\n    restart   Restart a container\n    rm        Remove one or more containers\n    rmi       Remove one or more images\n    run       Run a command in a new container\n    save      Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)\n    search    Search the Docker Hub for images\n    service   Manage Docker services\n    start     Start one or more stopped containers\n    stats     Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics\n    stop      Stop one or more running containers\n    swarm     Manage Docker Swarm\n    tag       Tag an image into a repository\n    top       Display the running processes of a container\n    unpause   Unpause all processes within one or more containers\n    update    Update configuration of one or more containers\n    version   Show the Docker version information\n    volume    Manage Docker volumes\n    wait      Block until a container stops, then print its exit code\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Information about Docker Setup\n\n\nWe can get the information about our Docker setup in several ways. Namely,  \n\n\ndocker -v  \n\ndocker version  \n\ndocker system info\n\n\n\n\n[Output of \ndocker -v\n]  \n\n\nDocker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40\n\n\n\n\n[Output of \ndocker version\n]  \n\n\nClient:\n Version:      18.03.1-ce\n API version:  1.37\n Go version:   go1.9.5\n Git commit:   9ee9f40\n Built:        Thu Apr 26 07:18:46 2018\n OS/Arch:      linux/amd64\n Experimental: false\n Orchestrator: swarm\n\nServer:\n Engine:\n  Version:      18.03.1-ce\n  API version:  1.37 (minimum version 1.12)\n  Go version:   go1.9.5\n  Git commit:   9ee9f40\n  Built:        Thu Apr 26 07:16:59 2018\n  OS/Arch:      linux/amd64\n  Experimental: false\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndocker system info\n command gives a lot of useful information like total number of containers and images along with information about host resource utilization  etc.\n\n\nLaunching our first container\n\n\nNow we have a basic understanding of docker command and sub commands, let us dive straight into launching our very first \ncontainer\n  \n\n\ndocker run alpine:3.4 uptime\n\n\n\n\nWhere,\n  * we are using docker \nclient\n to\n  * run a application/command \nuptime\n using\n\n  * an image by name \nalpine:3.4\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nUnable to find image 'alpine:3.4' locally\n3.4: Pulling from library/alpine\n81033e7c1d6a: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:2532609239f3a96fbc30670716d87c8861b8a1974564211325633ca093b11c0b\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for alpine:3.4\n\n 15:24:34 up  7:36,  load average: 0.00, 0.03, 0.04\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThis command will\n\n  * Pull the \nalpine\n image file from \ndocker hub\n, a cloud registry\n  * Create a runtime environment/ container with the above image \n\n  * Launch a program (called \nuptime\n) inside that container\n\n  * Stream that output to the terminal\n\n  * Stop the container once the program is exited\n\n\nWhere did my container go?\n  \n\n\ndocker container  ps\n\ndocker container  ps -l\n\n\n\n\nThe point here to remember is that, when that executable stops running inside the container, the container itself will stop\n\nThis process will further be explained under the \nlifecycle of a container\n topic.\n\n\nLet's see what happens when we run that command again,  \n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\ndocker run alpine uptime\n 07:48:06 up  3:15,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00\n\n\n\n\nNow docker no longer pulls the image again from registry, because \nit has stored the image locally\n from the previous run\n\nSo once an image is pulled, we can make use of that image to create and run as many container as we want without the need of downloading the image again. However it has created a new instance of the iamge/container.\n\n\nChecking Status of the containers\n\n\nWe have understood how docker run commands works. But what if you want to see list of running containers and history of containers that had run and exited? This can be done by executing the following commands  \n\n\ndocker ps\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n\n\n\n\nThis command doesn't give us any information. Because, \ndocker ps\n command will only show list of container(s) which are \nrunning\n  \n\n\ndocker ps -l\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES\n988f4d90d604        alpine              \nuptime\n            About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       fervent_hypatia\n\n\n\n\nthe \n-l\n flag shows the last run container along with other details like image it used, command it executed, return code of that command, etc.,  \n\n\ndocker ps -n 2\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nNAMES\n988f4d90d604        alpine              \nuptime\n            About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       fervent_hypatia\nacea3023dca4        alpine              \nuptime\n            3 minutes ago        Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                            mad_darwin\n\n\n\n\nDocker gives us the flexibility to show the desirable number of last run containers. This can be achieved by using \n-n #no_of_results\n flag  \n\n\ndocker ps -a\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS                  NAMES\n988f4d90d604        alpine                       \nuptime\n                 About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                          fervent_hypatia\nacea3023dca4        alpine                       \nuptime\n                 4 minutes ago        Exited (0) 4 minutes ago                               mad_darwin\n60ffa94e69ec        ubuntu:14.04.3               \nbash\n                   27 hours ago         Exited (0) 26 hours ago                                infallible_meninsky\ndd75c04e7d2b        schoolofdevops/ghost:0.3.1   \n/entrypoint.sh npm s\n   4 days ago           Exited (0) 3 days ago                                  kickass_bardeen\nc082972f66d6        schoolofdevops/ghost:0.3.1   \n/entrypoint.sh npm s\n   4 days ago           Exited (0) 3 days ago           0.0.0.0:80-\n2368/tcp   sodcblog\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will show all the container we have run so far.  \n\n\nRunning Containers in Interactive Mode\n\n\nWe can interact with docker containers by giving -it flags at the run time. These flags stand for\n\n  * i - Interactive\n\n  * t - tty\n\n\ndocker run -it alpine sh\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nUnable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from library/alpine\nff3a5c916c92: Already exists\nDigest: sha256:7df6db5aa61ae9480f52f0b3a06a140ab98d427f86d8d5de0bedab9b8df6b1c0\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest\n/ #\n\n\n\n\nAs you see, we have landed straight into \nsh\n shell of that container. This is the result of using \n-it\n flags and mentioning that container to run the \nsh\n shell. Don't try to exit that container yet. We have to execute some other commands in it to understand the next topic  \n\n\nNamespaced:\n\n\nLike a full fledged OS, Docker container has its own namespaces\n\nThis enables Docker container to isolate itself from the host as well as other containers  \n\n\nRun the following commands and see that alpine container has its own namespaces and not inheriting much from \nhost OS\n  \n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\ncat /etc/issue\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nWelcome to Alpine Linux 3.4\nKernel \\r on an \\m (\\l)\n\n\n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\nps aux\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nPID   USER     TIME   COMMAND\n    1 root       0:00 sh\n    6 root       0:00 ps aux\n\n\n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\nifconfig\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:AC:11:00:02\n          inet addr:172.17.0.2  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::42:acff:fe11:2%32640/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:648 (648.0 B)  TX bytes:648 (648.0 B)\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1%32640/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\n\n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\nhostname\n\n\n\n\n[Output]   \n\n\nae84d253ecb5\n\n\n\n\nShared:\n\nWe have understood that containers have their own namespaces. But will they share something to some extent? the answer is \nYES\n. Let's run the following commands on both the container and the host machine  \n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\nuname -a\n\n\n\n\n[Output - \ncontainer\n]  \n\n\nLinux ae84d253ecb5 3.10.0-327.28.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Aug 18 19:05:49 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux\n\n\n\n\n\n[Output - \nhostmachine\n]  \n\n\nLinux dockerserver 3.10.0-327.28.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Aug 18 19:05:49 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the container uses the same Linux Kernel from the host machine. Just like \nuname\n command, the following commands share the same information as well. In order to avoid repetition, we will see the output of container alone.\n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\ndate  \n\n\n\n\n[Output]    \n\n\nWed Sep 14 18:21:25 UTC 2016\n\n\n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n\n\n\n\n[Output]    \n\n\nprocessor       : 0\nvendor_id       : GenuineIntel\ncpu family      : 6\nmodel           : 94\nmodel name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz\nstepping        : 3\ncpu MHz         : 2592.002\ncache size      : 6144 KB\nphysical id     : 0\nsiblings        : 1\ncore id         : 0\ncpu cores       : 1\napicid          : 0\ninitial apicid  : 0\nfpu             : yes\nfpu_exception   : yes\ncpuid level     : 22\nwp              : yes\nflags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc rep_good nopl xtopology nonstop_tsc pni pclmulqdq monitor ssse3 cx16 sse4_1 sse4_2 movbe popcnt aes xsave avx rdrand hypervisor lahf_lm abm 3dnowprefetch rdseed clflushopt\nbogomips        : 5184.00\nclflush size    : 64\ncache_alignment : 64\naddress sizes   : 39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual\npower management:\n\n\n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\nfree\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\ntotal       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       1884176     650660    1233516          0       1860     473248\n-/+ buffers/cache:     175552    1708624\nSwap:      1048572          0    1048572\n\n\n\n\n\nNow exit out of that container by running \nexit\n or by pressing \nctrl+d\n  \n\n\nMaking Containers Persist\n\n\nRunning Containers in Detached Mode\n\n\nSo far, we have run the containers interactively. But this is not always the case. Sometimes you may want to start a container  without interacting with it. This can be achieved by using \n\"detached mode\"\n (\n-d\n) flag. Hence the container will launch the deafault application inside and run in the background. This saves a lot of time, we don't have to wait till the applications launches successfully. It will happen behind the screen. Let us run the following command to see this in action  \n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\ndocker run -idt schoolofdevops/loop program\n\n\n\n\n-d , --detach : detached mode  \n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\n2533adf280ac4838b446e4ee1151f52793e6ac499d2e631b2c752459bb18ad5f\n\n\n\n\nThis will run the container in detached mode.

Before running this command, run docker ps -a to see the list of pre run containers. Choose a container of your wish and then execute docker rm command. Then run docker ps -a again to check the removed container list or not  \n\n\n[Command]  \n\n\ndocker rm 590e7060743a\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\n590e7060743a",

But sometimes you might require to make some changes inside that container. In those kind of situations, we can use \nattach\n command. This command attaches to the tty of docker container. So it will stream the output of the application. In our case, we will see the output of vote application  \n\n\ndocker attach vote\n\n\n\n\nHit our blogs url several times to see the output  \n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\nroot@swarm-03:~# docker attach vote\n[2018-05-01 15:44:49 +0000] [1] [INFO] Handling signal: winch\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can detach from the tty by pressing \nctrl-p + ctrl-q\n in sequence. If you haven't started your container with \n-it\n flag, then it is not possible to get your host's terminal back. In that case, If you haven't started the container with \n-it\n option, the only way you will be able to detach  from the container by using \nctrl-c\n, which kills the process, in turns the container itself.   \n\n\nIt is possible to override these keys too. For that we have to add --detach-keys flag to the command. To learn more, click on the following URL  \n\n\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/  \n\n\nCopying files between container and client host\n\n\nWe can copy files/directories form host to container and vice-versa  \n\nLet us create a file on the host  \n\n\ntouch testfile\n\n\n\n\nTo copy the testfile \nfrom host machine to ghsot contanier\n, try  \n\n\ndocker cp testfile vote:/opt  \n\n\n\n\nThis command will copy testfile to vote container's \n/opt\n directory  and will not give any output. To verify the file has been copies or not, let us log into container by running,  \n\n\ndocker exec -it vote bash\n\n\n\n\nChange directory into /opt and list the files  \n\n\ncd /opt  \nls\n\n\n\n\n[Output]  \n\n\ntestfile\n\n\n\n\nThere you can see that file has been successfully copied.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to use the hosted registry i.e. Dockerhub.\n\n\nSteps to create Dockerhub account\n\n\nStep 1:\n\n\nVisit the following link and sign up with your email id\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n\n\nCheck your email inbox and check the activation email sent by docker team\n\n\nStep 3:\n\n\nAfter clicking on the activation link, you will be redirected to a log in page. Enter your credentials and log in\n\n\n\n\nYou will be launched to Dockerhub main page. Now the registration process is complete and you have account in Dockerhub!\n\n\n\n\nLab: Building Docker Images - A manual approach\n\n\nBefore we start building automated images, we are going to create a docker image by hand. We have already used the pre built image from the registry in the last session. In this session, however, we are going to create our own image with ghost installed. Since Ghost is a node.js based application, we will base our work on existing official image for \nnode\n\n\nClone Repository for Java worker app\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/schoolofdevops/voting-app-worker.git\n\n\n\n\nLaunch a intermediate container to install worker app\n\n\nCreate a Container with  \nschoolofdevops/voteapp-mvn:v1\n image\n\n\ndocker run -idt --name interim schoolofdevops/voteapp-mvn  sh\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy over the Source Code\n\n\ncd voting-app-worker\ndocker container cp .  interim:/code\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect to container to compile and package the code\n\n\ndocker exec -it interim sh\n\nmvn package\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify jarfile has been built\n\n\nls target/\n\njava -jar target/worker-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n\n\n\n\nMove the artifact, remove source code\n\n\n\nmv target/worker-jar-with-dependencies.jar /run/worker.jar\n\nrm -rf /code/*\n\n\n\n\n[output]\n\n\nWaiting for redis\nWaiting for redis\nWaiting for redis\nWaiting for redis\n^C\n\n\n\n\n[use ^c to exit]\n\n\nThe above is the expected output.
